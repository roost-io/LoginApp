ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Password
Issue: The Objects.hash(username, password) code suggests passwords are handled and potentially stored as plaintext. This can lead to unauthorized access if the data is exposed.
Solution: Ensure passwords are stored securely using proper cryptographic methods. Consider using Java's built-in libraries for hashing and storing passwords, like java.security.MessageDigest or use a proper crypto library that provides password hashing mechanisms, such as Bcrypt.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Hard-Coded Password
Issue: The password seems to be hardcoded. If the application is compromised, attackers can gain access to the hardcoded password.
Solution: Never hardcode passwords. Use securely managed environment variables or a secure configuration that the application reads at runtime.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: Objects.hash function does not generate sufficiently random values for session tokens or other random identifiers. This may lead to prediction of these values and compromise security.
Solution: Use SecureRandom for generating random values such as session ID's or tokens.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test if hashCode Generates Unique Value for Different Object Details

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeGeneratesUniqueValueForDifferentObject
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the hashCode method generates a different unique value for each unique object. Objects with different usernames and passwords should have different hash codes. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two objects with different usernames and passwords.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method for both objects.
    Assert: The hash codes for two different objects should not be equal.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method correctly creates unique values for distinct objects, thus managing object identification properly. It's crucial for maintaining uniqueness of objects in the application.
    
Scenario 2: Test if hashCode Returns Identical Result for Same Object Details

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeReturnsIdenticalResultForSameObject
  Description: This test is designed to confirm whether the hashCode method will return identical results for the same object. That is, if we invoke the hashCode method multiple times on the same object, it should consistently return the same integer value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object with a specific username and password.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the same object multiple times.
    Assert: The result derived from executing the hashCode method on the same instance multiple times should always be equal.
  Validation:
    The test verifies that the hashCode method maintains the general contract of the hashCode function in Java, which states that if a method is invoked on the same object multiple times, it should consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified.
    
Scenario 3: Test if hashCode Handles Null Values Gracefully

Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeHandlesNullValuesGracefully
  Description: It's crucial for the hashCode method to handle null values gracefully. Invoking hashCode on an object with null username or password should not throw a NullPointerException.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object with null username or password.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode method on this object.
    Assert: The method should not throw a NullPointerException.
  Validation:
    This verification verifies whether the hashCode method handles null values properly and doesn't throw a NullPointerException when invoked with null input values. It is a vital test to ensure that the application doesn't crash due to null input values.
