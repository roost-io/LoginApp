================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information exposure through an error message (CWE-209)
Issue: The usage of a toString() method that openly outputs details of the object, can lead to security risks as it may expose sensitive information about the object.
Solution: Remove any sensitive information from the toString() method if it is to be logged or displayed, or create a sanitized string representation for such purposes.

Vulnerability: Buffer overflow (CWE-120)
Issue: The usage of StringBuilder's append operation in an uncontrolled manner may lead to buffer overflow. This can possibly be exploited to execute arbitrary code, alter the intended control flow, read sensitive information, or cause the program to crash.
Solution: Ensure to limited the size of your StringBuilder in order to avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Review the usage of StringBuilder to ensure that its buffer capacity is neither exceeded nor approached closely, or better handle cases where the limit is reached (e.g., by resizing or throwing an exception).

""" 
  Scenario 1: Test verification of the toString method's return format

  Details:  
    TestName: verifyToStringFormat
    Description: This test is designed to verify the correctness of the returned format by the toString method. The test checks if the method is properly appending the required attributes and formatting the returned string correctly. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CredentialsObscuredGet200Response class and set the 'obscured' attribute.
    Act: Call the toString method of the created instance.
    Assert: Check if the returned string matches the expected output.

  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the toString method is correctly formatting the returned output. The correct format is crucial for appropriate representation and depiction of the object state in human-readable form.

  Scenario 2: Test verification of toString with null obscured

  Details:  
    TestName: verifyToStringNullObscured
    Description: This test checks the behavior of the toString method when the 'obscured' attribute is null. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the CredentialsObscuredGet200Response class with 'obscured' attribute set to null.
    Act: Call the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Check if the returned string correctly indicates that 'obscured' is null.

  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that the toString correctly handles null values of attributes. The toString method should provide a truthful representation of the object state, including null attribute values.

  Scenario 3: Test verification of toString with non-null obscured

  Details:  
    TestName: verifyToStringNonNullObscured
    Description: This test validates the behavior of the toString method when the 'obscured' attribute has been assigned a non-null value.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a instance of the CredentialsObscuredGet200Response class with 'obscured' attribute set to a non-null value.
    Act: Call the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Check if the returned string correctly reflects the non-null value of 'obscured'.

  Validation: 
    The assertion confirms that the toString method is correctly representing non-null attribute values. A correct representation of the object state, including its non-null attribute values, is required for proper debugging and logging purposes.
