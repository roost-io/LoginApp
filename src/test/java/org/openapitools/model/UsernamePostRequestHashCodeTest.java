================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-328: Reversible One-Way Hash
Issue: Using a one-way hash can expose an application to vulnerabilities if the hash is not properly salted. This makes the application susceptible to attack from rainbow tables.
Solution: Use a proper key derivation function from javax.crypto.SecretKeyFactory or use a well-vetted library that automatically salts hashes and handles hash iterations.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: Including hard-coded credentials in your Java applications can pose a significant risk. The attacker can extract the credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to systems.
Solution: Use environment variables to store credentials, or better yet, use a secure, dedicated mechanism for storing secrets like AWS Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: Without a careful review of what classes are allowed to be deserialized, an attacker can create instances of any class on the classpath, which can lead to arbitrary command execution.
Solution: Avoid deserialization of untrusted data. If this is not possible, ensure you put in place strict context-specific limitations on what classes can be deserialized.

"""
  Scenario 1: Valid Hash Code Generation

  Details:  
    TestName: generateValidHashCode
    Description: This test is meant to check the correct hash code generation from the given text field by using the hashCode() method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the text field with a valid string value.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode() method.
    Assert: Compare the generated hash code with the expected value which is calculated manually.
  Validation: 
    This will verify whether hashCode() method generates correct hash code or not. The expected result is based on the formula used by the hash() method of java.util.Objects class. It checks if the hashCode() method is working as expected and generating the correct hash values.

  Scenario 2: Hash Code Generation for Null String

  Details:  
    TestName: generateHashCodeForNullString
    Description: This test is meant to verify the hash code generation if the text field is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the text field with a null value.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode() method.
    Assert: The generated hash code is expected to be 0 as given by java.util.Objects class for null values.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to check if the hashCode() method handles null string values and returns the correct hash code for null, which is 0 according to hash() method in java.util.Objects class. This test ensures the robustness of our hashCode() method when dealing with null values.
  
  Scenario 3: Hash Code Generation for Empty String

  Details:  
    TestName: generateHashCodeForEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to verify the hash code generation if the text field is an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the text field with an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the hashCode() method.
    Assert: Verify that the generated hash code matches the hash code of an empty string as provided by java.util.Objects class.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify whether the hashCode() method returns correct hash for empty string or not. It also ensures our hashCode() method handles edge case of empty string.
