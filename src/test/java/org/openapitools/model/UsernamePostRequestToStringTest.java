================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The 'toString' method relies directly on the 'text' instance variable without conducting any form of input validation or sanitization. This behavior can render an application susceptible to security attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or similar injection attacks.
Solution: Implement validation and sanitization methods for any inputs assigned to the 'text' instance variable. You may want to use existing Java libraries such as OWASP's Java Encoder for HTML output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: As observed above, the data assigned to the 'text' instance variable is directly used without validating its content. Unvalidated or improperly validated data may lead to a range of security vulnerabilities depending on how and where it is used.
Solution: Implement robust input validation mechanisms before using input data. Use context-related validation based on the form of the input. Consider using built-in java features or libraries like Apache Commons Validator.

Vulnerability: CWE-451: Missing Function Level Access Control
Issue: There is no access control in place to regulate access to the 'toString' method. This lack of access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
Solution: Implement a proper access control mechanism in your code. Make sure only authorized users/entities have access to this method by using Java's built-in access modifiers such as 'private', 'protected', or 'public' appropriately.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid String Output Test

Details:  
  TestName: testValidStringOutput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method is returning the correct string representation of the UsernamePostRequest class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initiate an instance of the UsernamePostRequest class and assign some value to the 'text' variable.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the instantiated class. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the output string is formatted correctly and contains the expected value assigned to 'text'.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the toString method is working as expected and returning the correct string representation of the class. This test is crucial for ensuring the correct display and logging of class instance information. 

Scenario 2: Null Value Test

Details:  
  TestName: testNullValueHandling
  Description: This test checks how the toString method handles null values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the UsernamePostRequest class but do not assign any value to 'text'.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the instantiated class.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if 'null' is appended in place of the 'text' value in the resulting string.
Validation: 
  The test aims to verify that null values within the class are handled appropriately and do not cause exceptions or incorrect outputs. Especially in larger applications, correctly handling null values is crucial for preventing unintended behavior and runtime errors. 

Scenario 3: Empty String Test

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyStringHandling
  Description: This test checks the handling of an empty string by the toString method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiated the UsernamePostRequest class and assign an empty string to 'text'.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the instantiated class.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the resulting string correctly shows an empty string assigned to 'text'.
Validation: 
  The test verifies that the toString method handles objects that have been initialized but not assigned any values. This is important in the context of avoiding unexpected behavior or incorrect outputs when dealing with objects that may not have been assigned property values.
